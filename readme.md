### Why This Repository?
This is just a simple repository where I show the most interesting codes (based on data structure) I've come across.

### File Structure
Each folder corresponds to a programming language in which you find folders corresponding to problems where the solution and the statement of the problem are found.

### Where Do These Problems Come From?
These exercises come from various sources:  
- Leetcode  
- My own problems.
- Class Problems or exercises

### How You Can Contribute
